Overview
========
The CRC Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate checksums
for an ASCII string. Several CRC protocols are implemented using the CRC driver API.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This Example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set apropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: one
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.

Running the demo
================
Example output on terminal:
