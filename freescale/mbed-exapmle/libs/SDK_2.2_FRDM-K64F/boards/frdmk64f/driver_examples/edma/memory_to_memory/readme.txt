Overview
========
The EDMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It excuates one shot transfer from source buffer to destination buffer using the SDK EDMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the EDMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.80.4
- Keil MDK 5.21a
- GCC ARM Embedded 2016-5.4-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso0.8

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The EDMA memory to memory demo does not call for any special hardware configurations.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
